## What is an activity?

An activity represents anything you do that has an impact on your product. This could be your next feature, the translation of your website in a new language, a marketing campaign, or anything you want to measure over time.

Examples of Activities:

- Facebook campaign
- French translation
- New features
- New landing page
- New product page
- Launch of a new product

## Target

A Target, or segment, is a subset of user that will be affected by your activity.

!>If you don't set a Target, Smoothix will automatically split your userbase with the Period Start to do a Before/After comparison.

We recommend setting a Target to get better data. Furthermore, it is good practice to ask yourself what specific kind of users you are targetting. And there are plenty of filters available in Smoothix for that!

Examples of Targets:

- If you do a Facebook campaign, your Target would be `Source equals "facebook.com"`
- If you created a new feature, your Target would be `Page equals "/my-new-feature"`
- If you translated your website in French, your Target would be `Language equals "French"`

## Goal

An Activity Goal is the **why** you are doing this activity. At Smoothix, we think that everything you are doing needs to answer these questions:

- What Goal do I want to improve? Do I want more user to login? To purchase? To read a blog article?
- What metric am I focusing? Do I want to attract more visitors? Do I want to improve my conversion rate? Do I want buyers to make bigger purchases? Do I want my users to come back?
