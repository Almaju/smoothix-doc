# FAQ

- **Can I invite other people to my workspace?**:
  - Unfortunately, this is not possible yet but this is something that are we looking to develop asap.
- **How many workspaces can I create?**:
  - Right now, we are still in the Beta phase so you can create as many workspaces as you want.
- **Why do you need a read access to my Google Analytics?**
  - All our metrics and dashboard features are based on your Google Analytics data. We chose Google Analytics because we think they made an amazing product with great features (goals, segments, cohorts...) that will enable us to provide you the best user experience and the most reliable data.

  - We only gather your metadata (Goals, available Dimensions, etc.) and the Goal metrics related to your Activity (completions, conversion rate, and value).
- **How often is my data refreshed?**:
  - Your data is refreshed every 6 hours or upon a change of the activity properties.
- **Is there any limitation?**:
  - The only limitations are the Google API limitations which are tied to your user and IP. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/limits-quotas)

  - We don't have a dedicated support team (yet) but feel free to shoot an email to contact@smoothix.io if needed.
- **How do I delete my account?**
  - There is no automatic way of deleting an account (yet) but please contact us and we will delete your account and all its related data within 3 business days.
